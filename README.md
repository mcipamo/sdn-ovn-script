# OpenShift SDN â†’ OVN Migration - Runtime Validation Script

This repository contains a Bash-based validation tool designed to **monitor and verify the OpenShift SDN to OVN-Kubernetes migration** process in real-time.  
It helps Support Engineers, Customers, and Platform Administrators validate each step of the migration, identify blocked states, and ensure operator reconciliation during and after the transition.

---

## Overview

During the SDN â†’ OVN migration process, multiple components (MachineConfigPools, Network Operator, DaemonSets, and nodes) must transition in sync.  
This script continuously checks:

- Migration mode and status (`spec.migration.*`)
- Network operator health and reconciliation
- MCPs update and degraded status
- Pod health for key networking namespaces
- Network operator logs (real-time error parsing)
- Node CNI annotations (`ovn-kubernetes`)
- DNS pod status

---

## Usage

### Prerequisites
- **OpenShift CLI (`oc`)** configured and authenticated.
- Cluster-admin or equivalent permissions.

### Execution Modes

#### Single Validation Run
```
./sdn-ovn-check.sh
```

#### Continuous Monitoring (Recommended)
```
./sdn-ovn-check.sh --watch
```
Runs all validations continuously every 30 seconds (default interval).  
Press `Ctrl + C` to stop the loop.

#### Custom Interval Example
You can customize the refresh interval using `--interval=<seconds>`:
```
./sdn-ovn-check.sh --watch --interval=60
```
This example runs all validations every 60 seconds.
